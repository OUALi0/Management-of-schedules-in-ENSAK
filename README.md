# School Schedule Management System

Welcome to the School Schedule Management System project! This project aims to streamline schedule management for students, teachers, and administrators within a school environment.

## Overview

Managing schedules efficiently is crucial for the smooth functioning of any educational institution. This project provides dedicated spaces for students, teachers, and administrators to access and manage their schedules effectively.

## Key Features

- **Student Space**: Students can view their class schedules, upcoming assignments, and important deadlines.
- **Teacher Space**: Teachers can access their teaching schedules, manage class materials, and communicate with students.
- **Admin Space**: Administrators have access to a comprehensive overview of all schedules, manage user accounts, and make necessary adjustments to the system.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web pages and defining their content.
- **CSS**: For styling and enhancing the visual appeal of the user interface.
- **PHP**: For server-side scripting and dynamic content generation.
- **Link Between Pages**: Establishing high-level links between multiple pages for seamless navigation and interaction.

## How it Works

1. **User Authentication**: Users log in to their respective spaces using their credentials (student, teacher, or administrator).
2. **Space-specific Features**: Depending on their role, users can access features tailored to their needs. For example, students can view their class schedules, teachers can manage teaching materials, and administrators can oversee the entire system.
3. **Interaction and Navigation**: The system facilitates interaction and navigation between different pages, allowing users to seamlessly move between schedules, assignments, and other relevant information.
